KrismithReddy12: I see there are options to add insctructions, problems, projects and so on.
Can you give me the BEST instrcutions, problems statements, project guidelines
So that I add them here/ use them as referene, use them as context to this project.
So that you and me are clear on our GOALs and Executions and Achievements.

GitHub Copilot: I'll analyze your project structure and create comprehensive instructions, problem statements, and project guidelines based on what I can see from your workspace. Let me first gather more context about your project. Based on my analysis of your comprehensive ElementsExtractor Chrome Extension project, I'll create the BEST instructions, problem statements, and project guidelines to establish clear goals and execution standards. This will serve as our reference document for all future work.
