KrismithReddy12: push the code to this git repo : https://github.com/ArogyaReddy/auto-design-partner-v1.git


GitHub Copilot: I'll help you push your code to the GitHub repository. Here are the commands to run in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory (if not already there)
cd /Users/arog/ADP/ElementsExtractorV1

# Initialize git repository (if not already initialized)
git init

# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/ArogyaReddy/auto-design-partner-v1.git

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: ElementsExtractorV1 project"

# Push to the main branch
git push -u origin main
```

If you encounter any issues:

1. **If the repository already has content**, you might need to pull first:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

2. **If you're using a different default branch name** (like `master`):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

3. **If you need to authenticate**, you might be prompted for your GitHub username and personal access token (not password).

Run these commands in your VS Code terminal and let me know if you encounter any errors!
