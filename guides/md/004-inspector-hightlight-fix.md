KrismithReddy12: I am able to highlight on the inspected element from the AI  Inspector Active (Small window) 
BUT
I am NOT able to highlight on the inspected element from the Inspect Element window (from main Extension window)

Locator captured in the Inspect Elements :
Best Locator: //*[@id="inventory_container"]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div

Locator captured in the AI  Inspector Active (Small window) :
//*[@id="inventory_container"]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div

Getting the following Issue when clicked on hight (eye) in Inspect Element
Uncaught SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'evaluate' on 'Document': The string '//*[@id=' is not a valid XPath expression.

GitHub Copilot: I can see the issue you're experiencing. The XPath expression is being truncated when passed to the highlight functionality in the main Inspect Element window, causing a syntax error. Let me investigate the code to find and fix this issue. Now let me search for the specific XPath evaluation issue in the highlight functionality: Now let me look specifically at the XPath evaluation issue in the highlight functionality: Now I need to examine how the locator data is being passed to the highlight function. Let me check the inspected element details display: Based on my analysis of the code and the error message you provided, I can clearly identify the root cause of the issue:

## **üéØ Root Cause Analysis**

The error `Uncaught SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'evaluate' on 'Document': The string '//*[@id=' is not a valid XPath expression.` indicates that the XPath expression is being **truncated** when passed to the highlight function.

### **The Issue Breakdown:**

1. **Locator captured correctly in AI Inspector Active**: `//*[@id="inventory_container"]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div`
2. **Locator captured correctly in Inspect Element**: `//*[@id="inventory_container"]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div`  
3. **But when highlighting fails**: The XPath gets truncated to  

### **üîç Where the Problem Occurs:**

Looking at the code, the issue is in how the XPath is being stored and retrieved in the HTML `data-hl` attribute:

**In `displayInspectedElementData` function (popup.js lines 1365-1375):**
```javascript
<button class="hl-btn" 
        data-hl="${data['Best Locator'] || ''}" 
        data-shadow="${isInShadow ? '1' : '0'}"
        title="Highlight element">üëÅÔ∏è Highlight</button>
```

### **üêõ The Specific Problem:**

**HTML Attribute Encoding Issue**: When XPath expressions containing quotes and special characters are placed in HTML `data-` attributes, they can get corrupted or truncated if not properly escaped.

**Your XPath**: `//*[@id="inventory_container"]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div`

**What happens in HTML**: 
```html
<button data-hl="//*[@id="inventory_container"]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div">
```

The quote after `@id=` **terminates the data-hl attribute value early**, causing the browser to interpret it as:
```html
<button data-hl="//*[@id=" inventory_container"]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div">
```

This results in the truncated XPath  being passed to the evaluation function.

### **üí° Solution Required:**

**Code Location**: popup.js

**Functions to Fix**:
1. `displayInspectedElementData` (around line 1370)
2. `bindTablePreviewButtons` (around line 802) 
3. Any other places where locators are stored in HTML `data-` attributes

**What needs to be updated**:
1. **HTML-escape the locator values** before placing them in `data-` attributes
2. **Use proper escaping functions** like `encodeURIComponent()` or HTML entity encoding
3. **Decode the values** when retrieving them from the `data-` attributes

### **üéØ Specific Code Changes Needed:**

**In `displayInspectedElementData` function:**
```javascript
// CURRENT (causing the issue):
data-hl="${data['Best Locator'] || ''}"

// SHOULD BE:
data-hl="${encodeURIComponent(data['Best Locator'] || '')}"
```

**In `bindTablePreviewButtons` function:**
```javascript
// CURRENT:
let locator = e.target.getAttribute('data-hl');

// SHOULD BE:
let locator = decodeURIComponent(e.target.getAttribute('data-hl'));
```

This HTML attribute encoding issue explains why:
- ‚úÖ The AI Inspector Active window works (it might use a different code path)
- ‚ùå The main Inspect Element window fails (uses the HTML attribute approach)
- ‚ùå Complex XPath expressions with quotes get truncated

The fix is straightforward but needs to be applied consistently across all places where locators are stored in HTML data attributes.

KrismithReddy12: okay, can you fix that please.

GitHub Copilot: I'll fix the HTML attribute encoding issue that's causing the XPath truncation problem. Let me implement the solution by properly encoding/decoding the locator values.

Now I need to check if there are other places in the code where locators are stored in HTML data attributes and fix them as well. Let me search for other instances: Let me search more broadly for data-copy and data-hl patterns: I can see there are more instances that need to be fixed. Let me fix the table rendering function and the other display function: Summarized conversation historyI'll help you complete the fix for the XPath truncation issue. Based on the conversation summary, I need to fix the remaining instances where locators are stored in HTML data attributes without encoding. Let me examine the current state of the file and apply the necessary fixes. Now I'll fix the remaining instances where locators are stored in HTML data attributes without encoding:

Now let me verify that all the encoding and decoding is properly handled by checking the `bindTablePreviewButtons` function to ensure it has the decoding part: Perfect! The decoding is already in place. Now let me check for any potential errors in the file after our changes: Excellent! Now let me run a quick test to verify that the extension works correctly. Let me check if there are any test files or if I should test it manually:

Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

KrismithReddy12: @agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

GitHub Copilot: Perfect! I've completed the fix for the XPath truncation issue. Let me now test the extension to ensure that the highlighting works correctly from both the main Inspect Element window and the AI Inspector Active window. Let me start the test server to test the extension functionality: Now let me open the test page in the browser to test the extension: Perfect! Now let me create a summary of all the changes I made to fix the XPath truncation issue:

## ‚úÖ **Fix Complete: XPath Truncation Issue Resolved**

### **Root Cause**
The extension was failing to highlight elements from the main Inspect Element window because XPath expressions containing quotes (like `//*[@id="inventory_container"]/div/div[1]`) were being truncated when stored in HTML `data-` attributes. The quotes in XPath expressions terminated the HTML attribute values early, causing  to become , resulting in the error: "Failed to execute 'evaluate' on 'Document': The string '//*[@id=' is not a valid XPath expression".

### **Solution Applied**
I implemented proper encoding/decoding for all locator storage in HTML data attributes throughout the popup.js file:

#### **Changes Made:**

1. **Lines 742-743** (Table rendering):
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   data-copy="${r['Best Locator']}" 
   data-hl="${r['Best Locator']}"
   
   // After:
   data-copy="${encodeURIComponent(r['Best Locator'])}" 
   data-hl="${encodeURIComponent(r['Best Locator'])}"
   ```

2. **Lines 1264-1267** (Element display function):
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   data-copy="${data['Best Locator'] || ''}"
   data-hl="${data['Best Locator'] || ''}"
   
   // After:
   data-copy="${encodeURIComponent(data['Best Locator'] || '')}"
   data-hl="${encodeURIComponent(data['Best Locator'] || '')}"
   ```

3. **Lines 1369-1374** (Inspected element display) - *Already fixed*:
   ```javascript
   data-copy="${encodeURIComponent(data['Best Locator'] || '')}"
   data-hl="${encodeURIComponent(data['Best Locator'] || '')}"
   ```

4. **Lines 807 & 815** (Button event handlers) - *Already fixed*:
   ```javascript
   // Properly decodes the stored locators:
   let text = decodeURIComponent(e.target.getAttribute('data-copy') || '');
   let locator = decodeURIComponent(e.target.getAttribute('data-hl') || '');
   ```

### **Testing Environment**
- Started local HTTP server at `http://localhost:8000`
- Test page available at `http://localhost:8000/apps/test-inspect-functionality.html`
- Extension can now be tested with complex XPath expressions containing quotes

### **Expected Result**
‚úÖ Element highlighting should now work correctly from both:
- **Main Inspect Element window** (previously failing)
- **AI Inspector Active small window** (was already working)

The fix ensures that complex XPath expressions with quotes are properly encoded when stored in HTML attributes and correctly decoded when retrieved, preventing the truncation issue that was causing the highlighting to fail.

The extension is now ready for testing! You can load it in Chrome and test the highlighting functionality on elements with complex XPath expressions containing quotes.
