# Extension Fix Testing Plan

## Issue Summary
The automation tool was unable to highlight elements because it was generating CSS selectors that included its own highlighting class `.ai-extractor-highlight`, creating a circular reference.

## Fix Applied
Added filtering to remove extension-specific classes (starting with `ai-extractor-`) from CSS selector generation in:
- `popup.js` (both versions): `getBestLocator` and `getUniqueCssSelector` functions
- `contentScript.js`: `generateCSSSelector` function

## Testing Steps

### 1. Reload Extension
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Elements Extractor" extension
3. Click the reload button (↻) to refresh the extension with the new code

### 2. Test the Problematic Element
1. Navigate to the test page (likely Sauce Demo login page: https://www.saucedemo.com/)
2. Open the extension popup
3. Try to highlight the element: **"Accepted usernames are:"**
   - Element should be located at: `div#login_credentials > h4`
   - Expected: Element should highlight successfully ✅
   - Previous behavior: Failed to highlight ❌

### 3. Verify Clean CSS Selectors
1. Use the extension to generate selectors for various elements
2. Check that generated CSS selectors DO NOT contain `.ai-extractor-highlight`
3. Generated selectors should be clean, like:
   - ✅ `div#login_credentials > h4`
   - ❌ `div#login_credentials > h4.ai-extractor-highlight` (should not happen anymore)

### 4. Test Inspector Mode
1. Activate inspector mode in the extension
2. Hover over elements on the page
3. Verify that temporary highlighting works correctly
4. Verify that generated selectors from inspector mode are also clean

### 5. Browser Console Verification
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for debug messages
3. Look for messages showing:
   - Original classes vs filtered classes
   - Confirmation that `ai-extractor-` classes are being filtered out

## Expected Results
- ✅ Element "Accepted usernames are:" highlights successfully
- ✅ Generated CSS selectors are clean (no `.ai-extractor-highlight`)
- ✅ Inspector mode works without circular reference issues
- ✅ Console shows proper class filtering debug messages

## If Issues Persist
1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify the extension actually reloaded (check timestamps)
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Test with a different browser/incognito mode

## Success Criteria
The fix is successful when:
1. Previously failing element can now be highlighted
2. All generated CSS selectors are clean
3. No circular reference errors in console
4. Extension functionality works as expected
