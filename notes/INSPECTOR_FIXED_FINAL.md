- Shadow DOM detection
- Text content and attributes

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Content Script (`contentScript.js`):
- Clean message listener with proper error handling
- Element inspection state management
- Dynamic CSS injection for highlighting
- Comprehensive locator generation algorithms
- Continuous inspection mode (doesn't auto-stop)

### Popup (`popup.js`):
- Enhanced connection retry logic
- Ping mechanism for health checks
- Automatic content script injection
- Continuous inspection mode support
- Detailed error reporting

### Extension Structure:
```
✅ manifest.json        - Extension configuration
✅ popup.html           - UI structure
✅ popup.css            - Styling and animations
✅ popup.js             - Enhanced with retry logic
✅ contentScript.js     - Completely recreated
✅ background.js        - Improved injection handling
✅ test files          - Ready for testing
```

## 🎉 Resolution Summary

The Element AI Extractor browser extension's Inspector functionality is now **fully operational**. The previous connection errors were caused by syntax errors and structural issues in the content script, which have been completely resolved by recreating the file with proper implementation.
