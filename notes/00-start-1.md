Excellent! I'm excited to help you build this. Let's break it down into manageable stages.

Given your comprehensive vision, the most logical starting point is to establish the **foundational framework and a minimal working version of the test execution core.** We need something tangible to build upon.

**Stage 1: Core Setup and Basic Test Execution**

Here's what we should begin with now:

1.  **Project Initialization & Dependency Installation:**

    - Create your main project directory (e.g., `AI-Driven-Framework`).
    - Initialize a `package.json` file (`npm init -y`).
    - Install core dependencies:
      - Playwright: `npm install --save-dev playwright`
      - Cucumber: `npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber`
      - Assertion library (optional, but good practice, e.g., `chai`): `npm install --save-dev chai`
      - `ts-node` (if you prefer TypeScript for step definitions, though you specified JavaScript) and `typescript`. For JavaScript, ensure your Node.js version is compatible.

2.  **Basic Project Structure Setup:**

    - Create the initial folders based on your provided structure. For now, let's focus on the essentials for a basic test:
      ```
      AI-Driven-Framework/
      ├── features/
      │   └── Teams/
      │       └── TeamA/
      │           └── ProjectA/
      │               └── sample.feature  <-- Create a very simple feature file here
      ├── steps/
      │   └── sampleSteps.js           <-- Create a corresponding step definition file
      ├── playwright.config.js         <-- Basic Playwright configuration
      ├── cucumber.js                  <-- Basic Cucumber configuration
      └── package.json
      ```

3.  **Create a Minimal Viable Test:**

    - **`features/Teams/TeamA/ProjectA/sample.feature`:**

      ```gherkin
      @SmokeTest @Regression
      Feature: Basic Application Interaction
        As a user
        I want to perform a simple action
        So that I can verify the core functionality

        Scenario: Navigate to a website and check title
          Given I navigate to "https://playwright.dev/"
          Then the page title should contain "Playwright"
      ```

    - **`steps/sampleSteps.js`:**

      ```javascript
      const {Given, Then, BeforeAll, AfterAll, setDefaultTimeout} = require('@cucumber/cucumber');
      const {chromium} = require('playwright');
      const {expect} = require('chai'); // or use Playwright's built-in assertions

      setDefaultTimeout(60 * 1000); // 60 seconds
      let browser;
      let page;
      let context;

      BeforeAll(async function () {
        browser = await chromium.launch({headless: true}); // Set to false to see browser
      });

      AfterAll(async function () {
        if (browser) {
          await browser.close();
        }
      });

      // Hook for each scenario
      // Before(async function () {
      //   context = await browser.newContext();
      //   page = await context.newPage();
      // });

      // After(async function () {
      //   if (page) {
      //     await page.close();
      //   }
      //   if (context) {
      //     await context.close();
      //   }
      // });

      Given('I navigate to "{string}"', async function (url) {
        context = await browser.newContext(); // Create new context and page for each scenario for isolation
        page = await context.newPage();
        await page.goto(url);
      });

      Then('the page title should contain "{string}"', async function (expectedTitleSubstring) {
        const title = await page.title();
        expect(title).to.include(expectedTitleSubstring);
        await page.close(); // Close page after scenario
        await context.close(); // Close context
      });
      ```

4.  **Configure Playwright (`playwright.config.js`):**

    - For now, this can be very minimal as Cucumber will drive Playwright.
      ```javascript
      // playwright.config.js
      module.exports = {
        // You can define browser projects here if needed later,
        // but for Cucumber driving it, this file might be less critical initially.
        use: {
          headless: true, // Matches the headless setting in steps for consistency
          screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
          video: 'retain-on-failure'
        }
      };
      ```

5.  **Configure Cucumber (`cucumber.js`):**

    - Create a `cucumber.js` file in your project root.
      ```javascript
      // cucumber.js
      module.exports = {
        default: {
          paths: ['features/**/*.feature'],
          require: [
            'steps/**/*.js' // Path to your step definition files
          ],
          format: [
            'html:cucumber-report.html', // Generates an HTML report
            'summary'
            // '@cucumber/pretty-formatter' // For a nicer console output, install separately
          ],
          publishQuiet: true
          // You can add worldParameters here later if needed
        }
      };
      ```
      - You might want to install `@cucumber/pretty-formatter` for better terminal output: `npm install --save-dev @cucumber/pretty-formatter` and add it to the format options.

6.  **Add a Test Script to `package.json`:**

    ```json
    // package.json
    {
      // ... other properties
      "scripts": {
        "test": "cucumber-js",
        "test:teamA-projectA": "cucumber-js features/Teams/TeamA/ProjectA/sample.feature" // Example specific run
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```

7.  **Run the Test:**
    - Open your terminal in the project root.
    - Execute: `npm test`
    - You should see the test run and pass, and a `cucumber-report.html` file generated.

**Why start here?**

- **Verifies Core Toolchain:** Ensures Playwright, Cucumber, and Node.js are playing nicely together.
- **Establishes a Runnable Baseline:** You'll have a working end-to-end (though very simple) test.
- **Foundation for Parsing:** With actual feature files in place, we can then move to the next stage: building the logic to discover and parse these files to populate your UI lists.
- **Iterative Development:** This small, working piece allows us to build complexity incrementally.

Once this is set up and running, our **next immediate step (Stage 2)** will be to develop the **backend logic (Node.js scripts) to scan your `features` directory** and extract: _ Team names _ Project names (within teams) _ Feature file names/paths (within projects) _ Tags from within those feature files

This discovered data will be the source for populating your UI list boxes.

What do you think? Are you ready to lay this foundation?
