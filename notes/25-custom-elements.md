GitHub Copilot: I need to understand the context of this "Custom Elements" filter by exploring your workspace. Let me search for relevant code and documentation. Now let me search for more specific information about the Custom Elements filter functionality: Now let me read the specific popup.js file to get a better understanding of how the Custom Elements filter works: Now I understand the Custom Elements filter functionality. Let me provide you with a comprehensive explanation:

## What does the "Custom Elements" filter do?

The **"Custom Elements" filter** serves as a **universal catch-all selector** that captures **ALL elements** on a webpage. When activated, it uses the CSS universal selector `*` which matches every single element in the DOM.

## What are the "Custom Elements" meant by here?

The term "Custom Elements" in this context has a **dual meaning**:

1. **True Custom Elements**: Web Components with hyphenated tag names (like `<my-component>`, `<user-card>`, `<app-header>`). The code specifically detects these with:
   ```javascript
   if (el.tagName && el.tagName.includes('-')) return 'CUSTOM';
   ```

2. **Universal Element Selector**: Despite the name, it actually captures ALL elements because it uses the `*` selector:
   ```javascript
   filterCustom: '*'
   ```

## Difference between "Custom Elements" filter VS "All Elements" filter

| Aspect | **"All Elements" Filter** | **"Custom Elements" Filter** |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Function** | Master toggle that controls all other element type filters | Individual filter that uses universal selector (`*`) |
| **Behavior** | When checked: enables all specific filters<br>When unchecked: disables all specific filters | When checked: captures all elements regardless of type |
| **UI Role** | Checkbox that syncs with other checkboxes | Independent element type filter |
| **Selector Used** | Combines all selected filter selectors | Always uses `*` (universal selector) |

### Code Implementation:
```javascript
// "All Elements" - Master toggle logic
filterAllBox.addEventListener('change', function () {
  elementTypeList.forEach(type => {
    document.getElementById(type.id).checked = this.checked;
  });
});

// "Custom Elements" - Individual filter with universal selector
{id: 'filterCustom', label: 'Custom Elements', selector: '*'}
```

## What value does the "Custom Elements" filter add?

### âœ… **Key Benefits:**

1. **Complete DOM Coverage**: Ensures no elements are missed, even non-standard or newly introduced HTML elements

2. **Future-Proof**: Captures elements that might not fit into predefined categories (like new HTML5 elements or Web Components)

3. **Fallback Safety Net**: Acts as a backup when you need to extract elements that don't match specific type filters

4. **Web Components Support**: Specifically identifies custom elements (hyphenated tag names) and marks them as 'CUSTOM' type

5. **Debug & Discovery**: Useful for exploring unfamiliar websites to see all available elements

6. **Comprehensive Testing**: For automation testing scenarios where you need to interact with any element type

### **Use Cases:**
- **Web scraping**: When you need to extract data from any element type
- **Test automation**: Finding elements that don't fit standard categories
- **Web analysis**: Understanding the complete DOM structure of a page
- **Component discovery**: Identifying custom web components on modern frameworks

### **Performance Consideration:**
The filter includes a safety limit of 2000 elements to prevent performance issues:
```javascript
domElements = domElements.slice(0, 2000);
```

The "Custom Elements" filter essentially provides **maximum flexibility** and **complete coverage** when you need to work with any element on a webpage, making it a powerful tool for comprehensive element extraction and analysis.
