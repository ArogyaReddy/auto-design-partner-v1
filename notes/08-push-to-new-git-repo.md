## Summary

âœ… **Successfully completed!** Your code has been pushed to the new repository. Here's what was accomplished:

### What was done:
1. **Staged all changes** - Added all modified and untracked files to git staging
2. **Committed changes** - Created a commit with all your project files
3. **Added new remote** - Added the `automatic-agents` repository as a new remote
4. **Pushed to new repo** - Successfully pushed all 4,889 objects (21 files changed with 6,537 insertions)

### Your repository structure now includes:
- **Browser Extension**: Elements extractor bot with Chrome extension functionality
- **Test Apps**: Payroll demo and test syntax HTML files
- **Automation Framework**: Cucumber features, step definitions, and support files
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive notes and changelogs
- **Configuration**: Package.json, Playwright config, and other setup files

### Next steps you might consider:
1. **Update the README.md** in the new repository to describe the project
2. **Set up CI/CD** if needed for automated testing
3. **Configure the new repo** as your primary remote if you want to continue development there

Your code is now available at: **https://github.com/ArogyaReddy/automatic-agents.git**

The repository maintains both remotes:
- `origin`: Your original ElementsExtractor repository
- `automatic-agents`: Your new automatic-agents repository

You can continue working and push to either repository as needed!
