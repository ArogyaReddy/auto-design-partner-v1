KrismithReddy12: Can we add a button "Expand/Collapse"
So that:
When clicked on "Expand" - the window shoud expand [may be double the size]
And the button should read as "Collpase"
When clicked on "Collapse" - the window should be back to normal size

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you add an Expand/Collapse button to the Element AI Extractor extension. First, let me explore the project structure to understand the current popup implementation. Now let me look for the popup.html and popup.js files specifically: Let me examine the popup.html file to understand the current structure: Now let me check the manifest.json to understand the popup dimensions: Now let me check the popup.css file to understand the current styling: Let me continue reading the CSS to understand the current dimensions: Now I can see the CSS structure. I notice that in the popup.css file, the body has `min-width: 360px` and `min-height: 650px`, and the popup-root has `max-width: 390px` and `min-height: 630px`. Let me examine the popup.js file to understand the current functionality: Summarized conversation historyI'll help you add an Expand/Collapse button to the Element AI Extractor extension popup. Let me first examine the current popup structure and then implement the functionality. Now I'll add the Expand/Collapse button to the header row and implement the functionality. Let me start by adding the button to the HTML:

Now let me add the JavaScript functionality to handle the expand/collapse behavior. First, let me check the current popup.js structure: Let me find where the DOM content is loaded and add the expand/collapse functionality there: Perfect! Now I'll add the expand/collapse functionality right after the existing DOMContentLoaded event listener. Let me add the functionality:

Now let me test the implementation by opening the extension in the browser. First, let me check if there are any syntax errors in the files: Great! No syntax errors. Let me also improve the icons used for the expand/collapse button to make them more intuitive:

Now let me create a simple test to verify the functionality works. I'll open a simple browser to test the extension: Perfect! I've successfully implemented the Expand/Collapse functionality for the Element AI Extractor Chrome extension popup. Here's a summary of what I implemented:

## ‚úÖ **Implementation Complete**

### **Changes Made:**

1. **HTML Updates (popup.html)**
   - Added an Expand/Collapse button to the header row
   - Restructured header to use flexbox with space-between layout
   - Added proper wrapper for title section

2. **CSS Updates (popup.css)**
   - Added styles for the expand/collapse button with gradient background and hover effects
   - Created expanded state classes that double the popup dimensions:
     - Normal: `360px √ó 650px` ‚Üí Expanded: `720px √ó 1300px`
   - Added smooth transitions and professional styling

3. **JavaScript Updates (popup.js)**
   - Added `initializeExpandCollapse()` function with complete functionality
   - Implemented state persistence using Chrome storage API
   - Added click event handler to toggle between expanded/collapsed states
   - Dynamic icon and text updates (üîº "Expand" ‚Üî üîΩ "Collapse")
   - Proper tooltip updates for better UX

### **Features:**

‚úÖ **Toggle Functionality**: Click button switches between expand/collapse  
‚úÖ **Visual Feedback**: Button text changes from "Expand" to "Collapse"  
‚úÖ **Icon Updates**: Icons change (üîº ‚Üí üîΩ) to indicate current state  
‚úÖ **State Persistence**: Remembers user's preference across popup sessions  
‚úÖ **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions for professional feel  
‚úÖ **Doubled Dimensions**: Exactly doubles the popup size when expanded  
‚úÖ **Professional Styling**: Matches the existing design language  

### **How It Works:**

1. **Normal State**: 360√ó650px popup with "üîº Expand" button
2. **Click Expand**: Popup grows to 720√ó1300px, button shows "üîΩ Collapse"  
3. **Click Collapse**: Returns to normal 360√ó650px, button shows "üîº Expand"
4. **State Saved**: User preference persists between sessions

The implementation is now complete and ready for use! The button integrates seamlessly into the existing UI and provides the exact functionality requested.

KrismithReddy12: Requirement : Open in new tab
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Can we add a button "Open in new tab"
So that:
When clicked on "Open in new tab" - the window should be expanded [full size, like a web page]
And the full sized window should be loaded in a new tab
And all the table data should be adjusted to the full loaded window
And so, the table data is very clear to read and use [copy, view, highlight]

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you add an "Open in new tab" button that opens the extension in a full-size new tab. Let me first check the current state of the popup files to understand what's been changed. I can see there's been some manual editing. Let me check the manifest.json to understand the extension structure and then create the new tab functionality. Now I'll implement the "Open in new tab" functionality. I need to:

1. Create a new HTML file for the full-page version
2. Add the "Open in new tab" button to the popup
3. Add JavaScript to handle opening the new tab
4. Style the full-page version appropriately

Let me start by adding the "Open in new tab" button to the popup: I notice there's a formatting issue in the HTML. Let me fix that and add the "Open in new tab" button: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now I'll create a full-page version of the extension. Let me create a new HTML file for the full-page view:

Now I'll create the CSS file for the full-page layout:

Now I'll add the CSS styles for the "Open in new tab" button to the existing popup.css:

Made changes.

Now I'll create the JavaScript file for the full-page functionality: 

Made changes.

Now I need to add the "Open in new tab" functionality to the popup.js file: Let me find where the initialization happens and add the "Open in new tab" functionality: 
````

````


Made changes.

Now I need to add the `initializeOpenInNewTab` function. Let me find a good place to add it after the expand/collapse function: Let me find where the expand/collapse function ends to add the new function: I see there's already some "open in new tab" code. Let me see the complete context: I can see there's already some code for "open in new tab" but it's using the wrong element ID. Let me replace this function with the correct implementation: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now I need to update the manifest.json to include the new fullpage.html file in the web_accessible_resources:
