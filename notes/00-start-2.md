Okay, understood! We'll simplify the structure by having team folders directly under the `features` directory.

So, the path will be: `features/TeamA/ProjectA/sample.feature`

Let's proceed with this adjusted approach.

**Stage 1: Core Setup and Basic Test Execution (Revised Structure)**

1.  **Project Initialization & Dependency Installation:**

    - (This step remains the same as before)
    - Create your main project directory (e.g., `AI-Driven-Framework`).
    - Initialize a `package.json` file (`npm init -y`).
    - Install core dependencies:
      - Playwright: `npm install --save-dev playwright`
      - Cucumber: `npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber`
      - Assertion library (e.g., `chai`): `npm install --save-dev chai`

2.  **Basic Project Structure Setup (Revised):**

    - Create the initial folders:
      ```
      AI-Driven-Framework/
      ├── features/
      │   └── TeamA/                      <-- Team folder directly under features
      │       └── ProjectA/
      │           └── sample.feature      <-- Create a simple feature file here
      ├── steps/
      │   └── sampleSteps.js               <-- Create a corresponding step definition file
      ├── playwright.config.js             <-- Basic Playwright configuration
      ├── cucumber.js                      <-- Basic Cucumber configuration
      └── package.json
      ```

3.  **Create a Minimal Viable Test:**

    - **`features/TeamA/ProjectA/sample.feature`:** (Content remains the same)

      ```gherkin
      @SmokeTest @Regression
      Feature: Basic Application Interaction
        As a user
        I want to perform a simple action
        So that I can verify the core functionality

        Scenario: Navigate to a website and check title
          Given I navigate to "https://playwright.dev/"
          Then the page title should contain "Playwright"
      ```

    - **`steps/sampleSteps.js`:** (Content remains the same)

      ```javascript
      const {Given, Then, BeforeAll, AfterAll, setDefaultTimeout} = require('@cucumber/cucumber');
      const {chromium} = require('playwright');
      const {expect} = require('chai'); // or use Playwright's built-in assertions

      setDefaultTimeout(60 * 1000); // 60 seconds
      let browser;
      let page;
      let context;

      BeforeAll(async function () {
        browser = await chromium.launch({headless: true}); // Set to false to see browser
      });

      AfterAll(async function () {
        if (browser) {
          await browser.close();
        }
      });

      Given('I navigate to "{string}"', async function (url) {
        context = await browser.newContext();
        page = await context.newPage();
        await page.goto(url);
      });

      Then('the page title should contain "{string}"', async function (expectedTitleSubstring) {
        const title = await page.title();
        expect(title).to.include(expectedTitleSubstring);
        await page.close();
        await context.close();
      });
      ```

4.  **Configure Playwright (`playwright.config.js`):**

    - (This file remains the same as before, minimal for now)
      ```javascript
      // playwright.config.js
      module.exports = {
        use: {
          headless: true,
          screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
          video: 'retain-on-failure'
        }
      };
      ```

5.  **Configure Cucumber (`cucumber.js`):**

    - (This file remains largely the same. The `paths` glob `features/**/*.feature` will correctly pick up the new structure.)
      ```javascript
      // cucumber.js
      module.exports = {
        default: {
          paths: ['features/**/*.feature'], // This glob pattern still works perfectly
          require: ['steps/**/*.js'],
          format: [
            'html:cucumber-report.html',
            'summary'
            // '@cucumber/pretty-formatter' // Optional: npm install --save-dev @cucumber/pretty-formatter
          ],
          publishQuiet: true
        }
      };
      ```

6.  **Add a Test Script to `package.json` (Revised example path):**

    ```json
    // package.json
    {
      // ... other properties
      "scripts": {
        "test": "cucumber-js",
        "test:teamA-projectA": "cucumber-js features/TeamA/ProjectA/sample.feature" // Adjusted example path
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```

7.  **Run the Test:**
    - Open your terminal in the project root.
    - Execute: `npm test`
    - You should see the test run and pass, and a `cucumber-report.html` file generated. You can also try `npm run test:teamA-projectA`.

This revised setup aligns with your preferred directory structure.

Once this foundational setup is complete and working, our **next immediate step (Stage 2)** will be to develop the **backend logic (Node.js scripts) to scan your `features` directory** based on this _new_ structure (`features/TeamName/ProjectName/featureFile.feature`) to extract: _ Team names (e.g., `TeamA`, `TeamB` from `features/_`) * Project names (e.g., `ProjectA`, `ProjectB`from`features/TeamA/_`) _ Feature file names/paths \* Tags from within those feature files

This data will then be used to dynamically populate the selection lists in the UI we'll build later.

Ready to proceed with setting this up?

You're absolutely right! Organizing step definitions to mirror the feature structure is a great practice for maintainability and clarity, especially as the project grows.

Let's adopt this approach for the step definition files. We'll aim for a structure that can support both:

- `steps/TeamName/ProjectName/someSteps.js` (for project-specific steps)
- `steps/TeamName/commonSteps.js` (for steps common to a team, across its projects)
- And potentially even `steps/common/globalSteps.js` (for truly global steps, though we'll start with the team/project focus).

Here's how we'll adjust Stage 1 with this refinement:

**Stage 1: Core Setup and Basic Test Execution (Revised Step Definition Structure)**

1.  **Project Initialization & Dependency Installation:**

    - (Remains the same)

2.  **Basic Project Structure Setup (Revised for Steps):**

    - Create the initial folders. We'll place our `sampleSteps.js` in a path that mirrors our `sample.feature`:
      ```
      AI-Driven-Framework/
      ├── features/
      │   └── TeamA/
      │       └── ProjectA/
      │           └── sample.feature
      ├── steps/
      │   └── TeamA/                      <-- Team folder under steps
      │       └── ProjectA/
      │           └── sampleSteps.js      <-- Corresponding step definition file here
      ├── playwright.config.js
      ├── cucumber.js
      └── package.json
      ```

3.  **Create a Minimal Viable Test:**

    - **`features/TeamA/ProjectA/sample.feature`:** (Content remains the same)

      ```gherkin
      @SmokeTest @Regression
      Feature: Basic Application Interaction
        As a user
        I want to perform a simple action
        So that I can verify the core functionality

        Scenario: Navigate to a website and check title
          Given I navigate to "https://playwright.dev/"
          Then the page title should contain "Playwright"
      ```

    - **`steps/TeamA/ProjectA/sampleSteps.js`:** (Content remains the same, only its location changes)

      ```javascript
      const {Given, Then, BeforeAll, AfterAll, setDefaultTimeout} = require('@cucumber/cucumber');
      const {chromium} = require('playwright');
      const {expect} = require('chai');

      setDefaultTimeout(60 * 1000);
      let browser;
      let page;
      let context;

      BeforeAll(async function () {
        browser = await chromium.launch({headless: true});
      });

      AfterAll(async function () {
        if (browser) {
          await browser.close();
        }
      });

      Given('I navigate to "{string}"', async function (url) {
        context = await browser.newContext();
        page = await context.newPage();
        await page.goto(url);
      });

      Then('the page title should contain "{string}"', async function (expectedTitleSubstring) {
        const title = await page.title();
        expect(title).to.include(expectedTitleSubstring);
        await page.close();
        await context.close();
      });
      ```

4.  **Configure Playwright (`playwright.config.js`):**

    - (Remains the same)

5.  **Configure Cucumber (`cucumber.js`) (Crucial Change Here):**

    - Update the `require` path to scan the new structure. The glob pattern `steps/**/*.js` will effectively find step definitions in nested directories like `steps/TeamA/commonSteps.js` or `steps/TeamA/ProjectA/projectSpecificSteps.js`.
      ```javascript
      // cucumber.js
      module.exports = {
        default: {
          paths: ['features/**/*.feature'],
          require: [
            'steps/**/*.js' // This glob pattern will find all .js files in steps and its subdirectories
          ],
          format: [
            'html:cucumber-report.html',
            'summary'
            // '@cucumber/pretty-formatter'
          ],
          publishQuiet: true
        }
      };
      ```

6.  **Add a Test Script to `package.json`:**

    - (Remains the same, as `cucumber-js` command doesn't change based on step definition location if `cucumber.js` is configured correctly.)
      ```json
      // package.json
      {
        // ... other properties
        "scripts": {
          "test": "cucumber-js",
          "test:teamA-projectA": "cucumber-js features/TeamA/ProjectA/sample.feature"
        }
        // ...
      }
      ```

7.  **Run the Test:**
    - (Remains the same)
    - Open your terminal in the project root.
    - Execute: `npm test` or `npm run test:teamA-projectA`

This updated structure for step definitions makes the framework more organized and scalable. Cucumber, with the `steps/**/*.js` glob in its configuration, will be able to discover and load all your step definition files regardless of how deeply they are nested under the `steps` directory.

So, if you create `steps/TeamA/ProjectA/sampleSteps.js`, it will be found. If you later add `steps/TeamA/commonTeamASteps.js` or `steps/TeamB/ProjectX/anotherSteps.js`, they will also be automatically picked up.

With these adjustments, the foundation is even stronger. When you're ready, we can move on to **Stage 2: Backend Logic for File System Scanning** to populate your UI lists.
