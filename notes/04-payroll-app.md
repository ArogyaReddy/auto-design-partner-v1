I think, we need a good sample app to test the following and to use for our automation testing as a base app (Web app).



Test Incrementally:Test on a simple page.

Test on a page with Shadow DOM.

Test on a page with same-origin iframes.

Test on a page with same-origin iframes that also contain Shadow DOM.



Can you also get me a solid web app, it has every nature of website, every sort of web elements and it should be fucntional and usable for test scenarions and tests, right from login to logout.

Let's say, we do a sample payroll running app.



let's consider app with more Shadow Root and Shadow DOM elements.

Give me a website where these Shadow Root and Shadow DOM elements are in and so we can use our tool to see if it is scanning perfectly.

And we need to work more on Shadow Root and Shadow DOM elements to locate them perfectly with Primary and secondary locators techniques that we are following



Give me more complex elements strucures with all sorts of elements, forms, tables, lists, radios, combos, shadow dom, shadow-root, modell, popups, floating windows, full screen models, banners, links, buttons, texts, headings, images, all kinds elements .

So that we can use and test our tool



Give me more complex elements strucures with all sorts of elements, forms, tables, lists, radios, combos, shadow dom, shadow-root, modell, popups, floating windows, full screen models, banners, links, buttons, texts, headings, images, file uploads, downloads, all kinds elements .

So that we can use and test our tool

These all should be in a sample webapp

and so, we can use for automation testing too.

please use login, logout screens as well.

It should look like real applcaiton, like a payroll portal with test scenarions, like, login, logout, models, full screen models,banners, info, with all more complex elements strucures with all sorts of elements, forms, tables, lists, radios, combos, shadow dom, shadow-root, modell, popups, floating windows, full screen models, banners, links, buttons, texts, headings, images, file uploads, downloads, all kinds elements .



Please check the above and let's do.
